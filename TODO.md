Next steps
==========
- Create MD for github and publish to devlife.

Project goals
=============
- Build an app for Android N and O that allows designers and developers to keep their 
  phones awake while doing their work. 
- To save battery and for security, a lot of devices turn their screens off in about 10 minutes.
  This app extends that period indefinitely, as long as their phones are charging. 
- This app uses Quick Settings Tiles (that were available for Android N).
